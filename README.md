# Real-Time-Tool-Classifier
A real time object detection program which leverages computer vision and machine learning to classify different tools. Complied a dataset of over 500 images featuring a variety of screws, nuts, and tools which was utilized in a custom-made sequential machine learning model with an accuracy rate of over 80%. The model uses OpenCV to access the webcam and provide real-time classification ofequipment with additional instructions on use, safety briefings, and return location. Implementing program in Cornellâ€™s Bovay Civil Infrastructure Lab to improve organization
within the complex and assist students/researchers in safely and efficiently utilizing tools.
