# Real-Time-Tool-Classifier

This is a real time object detection program which leverages computer vision and machine learning to classify different tools. The model is trained on a custom dataset consisting of over 2000 images featuring a variety of screws, nuts, and tools with an accuracy rate of over 80%. The model uses OpenCV to access the webcam and provide real-time classification of equipment with additional instructions on use and return location. The program was implemented in Cornellâ€™s Bovay Civil Infrastructure Lab to improve organization within the complex and assist students/researchers in safely and efficiently utilizing tools.
